# Melody-Share
Created a web app where users record music using an interactive piano, drums, and voice input, to save to their profile, share, and upvote other usersâ€™ music (ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB). Users can view their dashboard to see graphs on their music preferences and get recommendations.
